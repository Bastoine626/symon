                                <h1>Ugandan president calls on Africa <br>to ‘save the world from homosexuality’</h1>
                                <p>The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, has called on African leaders to reject “the promotion of homosexuality”, 
                                  suggesting he will sign into law a controversial anti-LGBTQ+ bill, which was passed by parliament last month.
                                  The bill, which imposes the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality”
                                  and life imprisonment for “recruitment, promotion and funding” of same-sex “activities”, 
                                  has been widely criticised internationally, with the UN high commissioner for human rights urging the president not to sign it.
                                  Speaking on Sunday, Museveni said homosexuality was “a big threat and danger to the procreation of human race [sic]”.
                                  He said: “Africa should provide the lead to save the world from this degeneration and decadence, which is really very dangerous for humanity.
                                   If people of opposite sex [sic] stop appreciating one another then how will the human race be propagated?”

                                      <p>Weeks into investigations by Daily Monitor into this potentially multimillion black market rip-off,
                                        the Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority (UMRA) acknowledged that it is aware of the proliferation
                                        of illegal online money lending
                                        A key financial sector regulator last evening said it is soon releasing new guidelines in the face of a 
                                        rise in unlicensed online money lending dealerships through which unsuspecting Ugandans are facing extortionate and illegal interest fees.
