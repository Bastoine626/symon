            Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 with Queen Elizabeth II as head of 
            state and Queen of Uganda. In October 1963, Uganda became a republic but maintained 
            its membership in the Commonwealth of.The first post-independence election, held in 1962, 
            was won by an alliance between the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) and Kabaka Yekka (KY). 
            UPC and KY formed the first post-independence government with Milton Obote as executive prime minister, 
            with the Buganda Kabaka (King) Edward Muteesa II holding the largely ceremonial position of president.

        <p>Uganda's immediate post-independence years were dominated by the relationship between the central government and the largest regional kingdom – Buganda.[48]

            From the moment the British created the Uganda protectorate, the issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had always been a problem. Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked. This was further complicated by Buganda's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government. Buganda never sought independence but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left. This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence.[49]
            
            Within Buganda, there were divisions – between those who wanted the Kabaka to remain a dominant monarch and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state. The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties – the Kabaka Yekka (Kabaka Only) KY, and the Democratic Party (DP) that had roots in the Catholic Church. The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached. The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader, Benedicto Kiwanuka.[50]
            
            Outside Buganda, a soft-spoken politician from Northern Uganda, Milton Obote, had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People's Congress (UPC).
